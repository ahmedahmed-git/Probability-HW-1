1) 250C2 = 31125
 
2) 5C2 = 10

3) 2^3 = 8
 
4) 30*29*28 = 24360   OR   30C2 * 3P3 = 24360
 
5) 6C3 = 20

6) Probability of get 7 from 1 roll is = 1/6 ,,, probability of get none 7 is 5/6 ,,, you have to do 3 rools , so you have a probability (5/6)^3 of getting none 7 ,,, so we need one 7 at least ,,, so we can complement the none 7 probability to get the probability of get one 7 at least by do .. 1 - (5/6)^3 = 0.42

7) 6C3 - (2C2 * 4C1) = 16

8) (a) (2C1)^5  *  20C9 = 5374720   ///   (b) (2C2)^5  *  15C4 = 1365
